## Project Overview

This project serves as a hands-on exercise to understand and implement fundamental Next.js concepts. Starting from a basic `create-next-app` setup, it progresses through structuring a project, implementing simple page routing, designing reusable components, and incorporating TypeScript for robust type checking. The application is a basic "Airbnb Application Clone system" to demonstrate these concepts.

## Features

* **Next.js Pages Router:** Simple and direct file-based routing.
* **TypeScript:** Enhanced code quality and maintainability through static typing.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* **ESLint:** Code linting for consistent and error-free code.
* **Reusable Components:** Demonstrated with `Card` and `Pill` components.
* **Dynamic Components with Props:** `Pill` and `Button` components accept dynamic data and styles.
* **Image Optimization:** Utilizing `next/image` for efficient image loading.
* **Basic Styling:** Implementation of a simple and responsive layout for the landing page.
